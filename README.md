This is a repository where I upload my personal quantum computing projects. I started learning quantum information a month ago(July 2024) and I'm really enjoying it. This GitHub repository is therefore a small part of my quantum computing journey.
<br>
Projects-<br>
1. Quantum Teleportation<br>
2. Superdense Coding<br>
<br>
These are just small implementations of what I have learned till now.
